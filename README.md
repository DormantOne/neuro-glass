# Neuro-Glass v4

![Demo](assets/demo_small.gif)

A real-time neuroevolution playground where digital organisms evolve their own brain physiology to survive.

**Try it**: `pip install -r requirements.txt && python neuro_glass.py`

NEW EXPERIMENT:

3 Brick with vectorized hyperparameters (3brickvectordhyperparam) vs 3 Brick with controlled hyperparameters (3brickcontroldhyperparam)

Performance:
Control Best Score: 316 (Struggling to find a stable policy).
Evolution Best Score: 5,000+ (Hit the training cap, effectively infinite).
